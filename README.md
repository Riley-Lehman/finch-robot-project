# Final Project: Finch Robot Challenge

## Essential Question
How can we apply object-oriented programming principles and Java concepts to create interactive, autonomous robot behaviors that solve real-world challenges?

## Project Overview
In this project-based learning experience, you will program a Finch 2.0 robot to perform one of three challenges:
1. Choreograph a dance routine (with movement, lights, and sound)
2. Create an artistic drawing using the robot's movements
3. Navigate a maze autonomously

Your program must demonstrate your understanding of Java programming concepts from APCSA and object-oriented design principles while creating an engaging robot behavior.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply Java programming concepts in a physical computing context
- Implement object-oriented design principles
- Develop problem-solving skills through algorithm development
- Create well-documented and maintainable code
- Practice technical communication through presentations and documentation

## Description of Design Choices
We decided to create a basic square shaped face and gave it a blocky smile with two line eyes, the inspiration was derived from our intense emotions of pride and excitment as we are finishing the school year today. We used the color brown because it would show the best on camera and had to move the finch multiple times for the blank spaces in our drawing. 

## Challenges Faced and Solutions
The picture we decided to create was basic, but it had multiple blank spaces within it. Essentially, Ruby and I integrated pauses into our code so we would have enough time to move it and position it correctly. 

## Future Enhancements
In the future we wold most likely add more code, including colored lights and even more sounds, we decided to add sounds for extra pazaz, but if we had more time we would have made it even greater.
